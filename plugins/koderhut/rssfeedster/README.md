## RssFeedster

> Note: This plug-in extends and depends on the [RainLab's Blog](https://octobercms.com/plugin/rainlab-blog) plug-in to generate the feed.

An on-the-fly, W3C validated, customisable RSS feed builder plug-in.
The generated RSS feed was built according to the W3C standards. It includes all the required tags as well as a few optional ones, like copyright, feed category, feed language. These optional tags can help feed aggregators to better promote your feed.

The feed is built on request, so it always generates an up-to-date feed.
The plug-in is very customisable by both end-user as well as extendable by other developers.

## Features
- customisable URL
- feed built on request
- includes optional RSS fields for better integration with feed aggregators
- data source and renderer easily extendable by developers.
